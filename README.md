```
const tracklist = {
    musicSrc: [
        'assets/audd.mp3',
        'assets/chocolat.mp3',
        'assets/stay.mp3',
    ],

    coverSrc: [
        'assets/audd.png',
        'assets/chocolat.jpg',
        'assets/stay.jpg'
    ],

    title: [
        'Au DD',
        'Chocolat',
        'Stay'
    ],

    artist: [
        'PNL',
        'Rom√©o Elvis',

Care the order of your music. If you set a link a position 4, you have to set its corresponding elements at the position 4 in the other key of the tab
